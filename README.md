# 🥗 Better Food Logs – Project Story

## 🧠 Inspiration

The inspiration for Better Food Logs began with **Bedir**, who had been logging his meals for over five years. In that time, tracking food became a powerful tool in helping him reach and maintain fitness goals. His experience showed the real value in understanding one’s food intake, built on the timeless principle: **Calories In vs. Calories Out**.

However, during this time, common food tracking apps like **MyFitnessPal** and **FatSecret** revealed major limitations:
- MyFitnessPal often felt **too slow** and cluttered with features.
- FatSecret, while more lightweight, lacked meaningful **reporting** and ran on outdated technology.
- Some newer AI-based apps exist, but they are often **too expensive** or overly complex for everyday users.

From this realization, the idea of Better Food Logs was born: **a simpler, faster, and more accessible way to log food**.

What started as one person's need quickly turned into a shared mission, as **Julian**, **Vijay**, and **Damy** joined forces with Bedir to bring the concept to life.

### The mission:
- Include only **essential features** people will actually use  
- Make food logging as **frictionless** as possible  
- Keep it **free and user-friendly**

## 🚀 What It Does

Better Food Logs allows users to **log and track meals with minimal friction**. There’s no clutter, no distractions—just an easy way to enter foods, monitor calories, and stay consistent.

The focus is on speed, usability, and meaningful data.

## 🏗️ How We Built It

We built the application using modern web technologies and rapid prototyping tools:

- **Bolt** – Used to create and validate the first prototype  
- **Next.js** – Framework of choice for the frontend  
- **Supabase** – Backend services and user authentication  
- **PostgreSQL** – For storing food and log data  
- **Vercel** – For quick deployment and live hosting

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced

- **Sourcing nutrition data** was tougher than expected—we had to explore multiple options before landing on usable sets.
- Dealing with **page function bugs** and **database logic issues** took significant testing and debugging.
- Striking the right balance between minimalism and functionality was an ongoing discussion.

## 🏅 Accomplishments We’re Proud Of

- Built a functional web app with **a 4-person team** in a short amount of time
- Managed to stay within budget (we only spent on **coffee**, honestly!)
- Launched an app that worked well and sparked new ideas for what’s next

---

## 📚 What We Learned

- **Teamwork and focused collaboration** can achieve a lot in a short time
- Tools like **Bolt** help bring ideas to life faster than traditional wireframing
- Some team members gained new experience with:
  - Supabase for backend/auth
  - Vercel for deployment
  - React, PostgreSQL, and JSON handling
